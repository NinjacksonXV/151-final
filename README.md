# 151 Final
Project for CS-151 final at North Idaho College, written in C++ and using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). 

Currently, the current [CMake template file](https://github.com/SFML/cmake-sfml-project) is used directly. It builds SFML locally with your selected compiler and works crossplatform. IT's recommended to use it with the CMake-Tools extension when using it in VSCode, as it greatly simplifies the process.
